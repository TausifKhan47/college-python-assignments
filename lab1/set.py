my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

#check 
#print(set1 + set2)
#The + operator only works with sequences like list, tuple, or str.
#Sets are not sequences, they are unordered collections,
#  so you cannot use + to combine two sets.
# if we want to combine the two sets we use |(this union operator)
#eg:-print(set1 | set2) like this;
